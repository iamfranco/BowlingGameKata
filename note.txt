1 game = 10 frames

1 frame = 2 tries

if 2 tries and not all knocked down
   then score = total knocked down pins in 2 tries

if 2 tries and all knocked down (spare)
   then score = 10 + next try's pins

if 1 try and all knocked down (strike)
   then score = 10 + next 2 tries' pins

if 10th frame and we get spare or strike
   then get bonus throws and add those scores
